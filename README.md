This Weight Estimation System is made up of two major scripts, the cropByLineAngle.py and Dash.py. 
To run this system you must have a .bag image and a color depth image stored in a folder for each cow nested within the FarmVisit7 folder. 

Once your required data is stored within the FarmVisit7 directory, you can run the following script. You must then use your keyboard to change the dimensions on the image. Keyboard instructions can be found commented within the code itself. After you go through all of the images the data will be sent to a database location. 

After this process of running the cropByAngle.py, you then run the Dash.py. This will disply your data that has been collected from automated weight estimation system. To see this dashboard go to your local host 127.0.0.1:8050
